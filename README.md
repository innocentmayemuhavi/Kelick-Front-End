# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

### 2. Run the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

The development server will run on the default port, typically 5173. You can access your application at `http://localhost:5173`.
